After talking to my manager the only essential learning plan that I am required to complete is python although after asking around linux administration may also be useful.

As of Monday 26/11 i have completed all the basic python tasks and so am looking to have the intermediate tasks finished by friday 

The object level after that finished by Wednesday week.

The advanced level finished by Friday

I will look to complete python equivalent projects along the way and perhaps extra depending on hoe long the course takes 

Should i finsh early i will look to progress the linux course
